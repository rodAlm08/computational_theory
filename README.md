# Computational Theory Assessment Repository

Rodrigo Almeida - G00377123

## About This Project
This project is an analytical and computational exploration of the numbers round from the popular TV programme, Countdown. In this challenge, contestants are given six numbers, chosen from a predefined list, and a randomly generated target number between 101 and 999. The task is to use the six numbers, through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to reach the target number within 30 seconds.

A unique aspect of this challenge is the constraint that each number can only be used once, and operations must result in whole numbers. This project aims to replicate the contestant's challenge by developing a Python function, that takes a list of six numbers and a target number, attempting to find a solution that either exactly reaches the target or comes as close as possible.


## Use of This Project
This project serves as a practical application of computational theory highlighting how computers address mathematical challenges, demonstrating the power to solve complex numerical challenges. Additionally, the project explores imperative vs. functional programming paradigms, with insights into their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving.
