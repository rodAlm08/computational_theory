This approach aims to generate all valid expressions using pipeline of transformations and selections, finding the best solution through a reduction operation (`min` function). Additionally, the use of `decorators` in functional programming further exemplifies its principles by adding behaviour to functions without modifying their core logic.\n",

    "    - **Functional approach** has a high abstraction level that might introduce performance overhead. However, modern compilers and interpreters have become quite efficient at optimizing functional code. The declarative nature of functional programming can lead to clearer opportunities for parallel execution and optimization.\n",
    "    - **Imperative approach** can be more performance-oriented, especially for tasks requiring fine-grained control over execution and state management. For computational-heavy tasks where performance is critical, an imperative approach might offer more direct control over the optimizations."
